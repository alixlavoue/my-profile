   <p>
  	I am 19 years old, I am parsian and a 1st year student at IESEG school of management in the BIB program. I'm really interested in sports since I practice a lot of different ones. For example, I have done boxing for 4 years now and dance for approximatively 7 years. I also like hanging out with my friends and things like painting, design etc.

   <h2>Sport 🏆🏅🥊</h2>
   <p>
  	I am passionate about sports. I think it is a great way to destress, it really helps me to keep a positive mindset. It's also a good thing to do when you're bored or even a great thing to practice with friends. Sports are and absolutely necessity for me and I really feel off when I don't practice any kind of sports for a long time. The current situation with the covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown was particularly difficult for me because I wasn't able to practice sports the way I did before.

   <h2>Drawing and Drama 🎨🎭</h2>
   <p>
  	I am passionate about Drawing and Painting. I really like drama too, it's an origanal way to express myself. I think I like it because it allows me to express myself in another way that with regular words, that can be difficult sometimes. I've been doing drama for several years and I really enjoy it. I like the way it makes me feel and how it allows me to be more outgoing bu embodying different kind of characters and sides of my personality.
